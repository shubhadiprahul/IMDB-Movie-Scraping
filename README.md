IMDB-Movie-Scraper
In this project, I have made a IMDB Scraper (https://www.imdb.com/india/top-rated-indian-movies/?ref_=nv_mv_250_in) in which I have scraped a total of 250 movies using BeautifulSoup and Requests Library, and performed different analysis based on years, decades, genres, directors, languages and casts. I have also stored all the data in the cache files in json format.
